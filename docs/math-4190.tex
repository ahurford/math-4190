\emph{Assignment 1, Q5-6: to be handed in on Brightspace by Tues Jan 19
at 2pm.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

When deriving a mathematical model, some practical advice is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Modifying an existing model to suit your purposes is often a good
  approach; and\\
\item
  The units in the terms of your model need to be consistent.\\
\end{enumerate}

We would like to derive a mathematical model for the following:

\emph{Cooling beer in the freezer}\\
Room temperature beer can be cooled down by putting it in the freezer.
If left too long, the beer will freeze and burst the glass making it
undrinkable. How long can the beer be left in the freezer?

Read Box 2.1 on p30-31 of
\href{https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/MUN/detail.action?docID=768551}{A
biologists guide to mathematical modelling}.

Step 1 of the modelling process has been completed because the question
has been provided. Next, we will skip to Step 4. Read about the
\emph{cooling cup of coffee} model below. We can borrow the
\emph{cooling cup of coffee} model to use as our model for the
\emph{cooling beer in the freezer} question.

\section{The cooling cup of coffee}\label{the-cooling-cup-of-coffee}

The following is taken from Barnes \& Fulford (2002), section 9.1-9.2
starting of p218.

We would like to know how long it will take a 60\(^\circ\)C cup of
coffee to drop to 40\(^\circ\)C. To develop the model, we assume the cup
of coffee is a uniform temperature throughout. The cup of coffee will
cool as heat energy from the coffee is lost to its surroundings, which
are at a lower temperature. Note that temperature is measured in degrees
Celsius, while heat is measured in Joules or Watts (Joules per second).

From physics, the equation for the change in the heat content of coffee,
\(Q_{hc}\) (in Watts) is,

\begin{equation}
Q_{hc} = cm \frac{dU(t)}{dt},
\end{equation}

where \(c\) is the heat specific constant (measured in Joules per degree
Celcius per kilogram), \(m\) is the mass of the material being heated or
cooled (in kilograms), and \(U(t)\) is the temperature in Celcius.

Also, from physics the rate of heat exchange of an object which is
hotter than its surroundings, \(Q_{cs}\), (in Watts) is,

\begin{equation}
Q_{cs} = hS(U(t)-u_s),
\end{equation}

where \(h\) is the constant of convective heat transfer (in Watts per
\(m^2\) per degree Celcuis), \(S\) is the surface area from which heat
is lost, \(U(t)\) is the temperature of the object and \(u_s<U(t)\) is
the temperature of the surroundings (in Celcius).

Owing to the conservation of heat energy, the change in the heat content
of coffee, \(Q_{hc}\), should be equal to the rate of heat exchange from
the coffee to its surroundings, \(Q_{cs}\). As such, the equation for
the cooling of the cup of coffee is,

\begin{equation}
cm \frac{dU(t)}{dt}=-hS(U(t)-u_s).
\label{eq:LL}
\end{equation}

The negative sign on the righthand side of equation \eqref{eq:LL} is to
make sure both sides of the equation are consistent because
\(\frac{dU(t)}{dt}\) is negative while all other terms are positive.
This is a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). It is possible to
integrate this ODE to solve for \(U(t)\). If we assume that
\(U(0) = 60^\circ C\) we can then solve \(t_{40}\) such that
\(U(t_{40}) = 40^\circ\) C.

Assume the constant of convective transfer is 10
Watts/m\(^2\)/\(^\circ\)C.

\chapter{A2. Tues Jan 19: Deriving ordinary differential equation
models}\label{a2.-tues-jan-19-deriving-ordinary-differential-equation-models}

\emph{Assignment 2: to be handed in to Brightspace on Tues Jan 26 by
2pm.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Ordinary differential equation (ODEs) models are often appropriate for
MATH 4190 final projects. The general form of an ODE model is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:genCT}
\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \mbox{rate of increase} - \mbox{rate of decrease}.
\end{equation}

The units of rate quantities are `per time', although this may be number
per time, mL per time, or simply, per time. The ODE model may contain
multiple (or no) increase and/or decrease terms and there may be several
equations coupled together.

Generally, a parameter that correspnds to a rate is either constrained
to be positive, non-negative, or has no constraints. When the rate
parameter is \(>1\) this means that, on average, more than one of the
corresponding event occurs per time unit. Sometimes rate parameters are
multiplied by probabilities. A parameter that is a probability is
constrained to be \(\geq 0\) and \(\leq 1\).

When deriving ODE models it is helpful to draw a diagram (i.e.~Step 3,
Box 2.1 on p30-31 of
\href{https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/MUN/detail.action?docID=768551}{A

\section{Questions A2-1}\label{questions-a2-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Draw a flow diagram for one of the systems of ODEs in

  Mathematical Modelling of COVID-19 in Humans} by Hernandez-Vargas and
  Velasco-Hernandeza. For the system of ODEs that you chose, provide a
  table listing the variables and the parameters, their units, and any
  constraints on their values. Be sure to clearly identify which are
  parameters and which are variables. To make your flow diagram, follow
  the rules described in Box 2.3: Drawing flow diagrams, on p44 of
  \href{https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=768551\&ppg=44}{A

  need to be completed in Latex. You may work with pencil and paper and
  photograph your work. {[}5 marks{]}
\item
  Derive your own system of ODEs for a between-host epidemic spread
  model. Assume that the epidemiology of the system is such that:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The system has 3 variables: Susceptible host, \(S(t)\), Infected
  hosts, \(I(t)\), and Recovered hosts, \(R(t)\). For all of these
  variables the units are number.
\item
  The rate that new susceptible hosts enter the population is
  \(\theta>0\) (units: number/time).
\item
  The rate that susceptible hosts become infected due to coming into
  contact with the infected host is \(\beta S(t) I(t)/N(t)\), where
  \(N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)\), and \(\beta>0\) is the transmission
  rate (units: 1/time). This term results in both a decrease in
  \(\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\) and an increase in \(\frac{dI(t)}{dt}\).
\item
  The rate that infected indviduals recover is \(\gamma I(t)\), where
  \(\gamma >0\) (units: 1/time). This term results in both a decrease in
  \(\frac{dI(t)}{dt}\) and an increase in \(\frac{dR(t)}{dt}\).
\item
  Recovered individuals lose immunity at rate \(\omega R(t)\). This term
  results in both a decrease in \(\frac{dR(t)}{dt}\) and an increase in
  \(\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\).

\chapter{A2. Thurs Jan 21: Deriving recursion equation
models}\label{a2.-thurs-jan-21-deriving-recursion-equation-models}

\emph{Assignment 2: to be handed in to Brightspace on Tues Jan 26 by
2pm.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Recursion equation models update the value of your dependent variables
at regular intervals, i.e.~after one year, rather than continuously as
they would for an ordinary differential equation model. Recursion
equation models are referred to as discrete time models, whereas
ordinary differential equation models are referred to as continuous time
models.

The general equation for a recursion equation is,

\begin{equation}
n_{t+1} = n_t + \mbox{increase} - \mbox{decrease},
\label{eq:general}
\end{equation}

where \(n_{t+1}\) is the value of the variable at time, \(t+1\). Each
term in the recursion equation \eqref{eq:general} has the same units as
the variable of interest. More complex models may consider the dynamics
of multiple variables as systems of coupled recursion equations.

For recursion equations, within a time step multiple events may occur.
When an event occurs, the value of a variable will change, and so for
recursion equation models, is it necessary to define an order of events.

For example, consider a population dynamic model,

\begin{equation}
n_{t+1} = (1+b)(1-d)n_t,
\label{eq:BD}
\end{equation}

where \(n_t\) is the number of individuals in the population, \(b>0\) is
the number of offspring produced per individual in a time step
(unitless) and \(0 \leq d \leq 1\) is the probability that an individual
dies during a time step (unitless). What order of events has been
assumed in equation \eqref{eq:BD}?

Formally, we might define \(n'\) as the number of individuals after
births, and \(n''\) as the number of individuals after mortality. Then,

\begin{eqnarray}
n' &=& n_t + bn_t = (1+b)n_t, \\
n'' &=& n' - dn' = (1-d)n', \\
n'' &=& (1-d)(1+b)n_t, \\
n_{t+1} &=& (1-d)(1+b)n_t.
\end{eqnarray}

The above derivation assumes that births occur first and then mortality.
Assuming the opposite: mortality occurs first and then births, would
result in the same equation, however this is not always the case.

\section{Questions A2-2}\label{questions-a2-2}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Assume that \(\theta > 0\) is the rate that individuals migrate into a
  population (units: number). Assume that \(b>0\) is the per individual
  birth rate (unitless) and \(0 \leq d \leq 1\) is the probability that
  an individual dies during the time step (unitless). Choose two
  different orderings of events (migration, births, and deaths) such
  that the final equations are different. {[}4 marks{]}

  and,\\

  \begin{equation}
  n_{t+1} = bn_t,
  \label{eq:BD2}
  \end{equation}

  where \(b\) is a per individual birth rate (unitless). How might the
  description of \(b\), and the constraints on \(b\), be slightly
  different under either model formulation?\\[2\baselineskip]The
  population grows when \(n_{t+1}>n_t\). Assuming \(n_0 >0\), what are
  the values of \(b\) for which the population grows under either model
  formulation? {[}2 marks{]}

\chapter{A3. Tues Jan 26: Analysis of dynamical
systems}\label{a3.-tues-jan-26-analysis-of-dynamical-systems}

\emph{Assignment 3: to be handed in to Brightspace on Tues Feb 2 by
2pm.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

An important step in the modelling process is analyzing the mathematical
model to answer the research problem. We know that mathematical models
need not necessarily be ordinary differential equations and recursion
equations, however, given the pre-requisites for MATH 4190, we will
focus on these equations. Furthermore, we generally consider models that
are dynamical systems (the independent variable is time), such that
commonly we address research problems considering the future value of a
dependent variable.

Although we often want to know the value of the dependent variables in
the future, usually it is not possible to solve our models to explicitly
find a formula for the value of the dependent variable in the future.
The exceptions are linear ODEs and recursion equations,\\

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy(t)}{dt} = a y(t) + b, \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad y_{t+1} = a y_t + b,
\end{equation}

including multivariate versions of these equations. Such linear
equations can be solved explicitly as was done for the \emph{Cooling
beer in the freezer} problem on Assignment 1.

Many of the mathematical models that we will study are nonlinear systems
of ordinary differential equations and recursion equations. These cannot
be solved to find the value of the dependent variable for any time,
however, we can still make inferences about the dynamics of these models
by finding equilibria and performing local stabilty analyses. Such
analyses should be review from your prerequisite course work in
\emph{Dynamical systems} (MATH 3100), and additionally guidance on how
to find equilibria and determine local stability is found in
\href{https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=768551\&ppg=326}{Chapter
8 of Otto and Day}.

\section{Questions A3-1}\label{questions-a3-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The following system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential
  equations has one equilibrium:\\

  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dx(t)}{dt} & = & a - bx(t)y(t),\\
  \frac{dy(t)}{dt} & = & bx(t)y(t) - cy(t),\\
  \end{eqnarray}

  You should assume that all parameters and initial values of the
  variables are positive. Solve for the equilibrium and provide the
  conditions for the equibrium to be positive and locally stable. Show
  all your work. {[}5 marks{]}\\
\item
  The following nonlinear recursion equation has two equilibria:\\

  \begin{equation}
  x_{t+1} = a x_t e^{-x_t}+bx_t
  \end{equation}

  You should assume that all parameters and the initial value of the
  variable is positive. Solve for all equilibria and provide the
  conditions for each equibrium to be non-negative and locally stable.
  For the equilibrium, where \(x^*\) can be greater than zero, write the
  condition for local stability in relation to \((1-b)x^*\). Show all
  your work. {[}6 marks{]}
\item
  From question 2, comment on the conditions for the local stability of
  each equilibrium relative to the other, and the positivity of the
  equilibria. {[}1 mark{]}

\chapter{Final project}\label{final-project}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Oral presentation - 15\% (week of April 5)
\item
  Written Project - 50\% (due Monday April 12 at 9am)
\end{itemize}

The main focus of the second half of MATH 4190 is the final project. You
are to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  derive and analyze an original mathematical model,
\item
  extend and analyze an existing mathematical model, or
\item
  explain, recreate and/or produce novel proofs for an existing analysis
  of a mathematical model involving advanced mathematics (i.e., graduate
  level).
\end{itemize}

\section{Written Report}\label{written-report}

Your written report should consist of four sections: Introduction,
Model, Results, and Discussion (for more details see below). You must
appropriately acknowledge results and models that are not your own work.
Your written report must be no more than 10 pages (excluding references,
figures, and appendices) and written in Latex. If you have more than 10
pages of important content, then you should choose to place some of this
content in an Appendix.

Some advice: - Start simple. Start with a model that you are confident
that you will be able to produce some results for. When you fully
understand simpler versions of your model, gradually add in more
complexity. This prevents you from tackling a project this is `too hard'
and not getting any results. - Be concise. A good project is
thoughtfully put together -- it does not necessarily need to be overly
complex or long.

Guidelines for each section of the final project:

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe the general question/problem of interest.
\item
  Describe the real-world application in language that is accessible to
  a reader without prior knowledge of the application.
\item
  Summarize relevant previous research from the scientific literature
  (i.e., scholarly journals and books) and clearly place the project
  within the context of what has already been done. Remember to cite
  modeling articles, not just articles that describe the details of your
  applied system.
\item
  Don't focus your literature research to narrowly. For example, if you
  project is on `moose-wolf population dynamics' consider also the
  literature on predator-prey dynamics, which may contain mathematically
  equivalent model formulations.
\item
  Concisely state the main objective, hypothesis or question of the
  project.
\item
  Usually ends with a paragraph describing how the problem will be
  solved, i.e., the type of model and the type of analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model}\label{model}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Your model should be a dynamical system. The model cannot be an
  autonomous linear system of differential equations or difference
  equations because the analysis of such a model is too simple. You may
  however, consider a simplification of the model you are interested in
  that is an autonomous linear system of equations, if it helps you to
  understand the non-linear or non-autonomous system of interest.
\item
  Provide all details of the model to be analyzed. Define all the model
  parameters, variables, provide their word definitions and state their
  units. Provide the complete system of equations that comprises the
  model. If appropriate provide a table of parameter values (and
  references if literature sources are used to justify choices of
  parameter values).
\item
  You should describe the assumptions of your model.
\item
  You should provide enough detail that your model is reproducible. This
  may mean that you need to appendicize some material.
\item
  Consider including a diagram that communicates the interactions
  present in your model. This is often useful.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If possible, consider special cases of your model that yield
  analytical solutions such as equilibria and local stability
  conditions.
\item
  If it is possible to solve for the equilibrium values and/or to
  determine the local stability of equilibria for your model you must do
  so.
\item
  Usually the results section of a MATH 4190 project includes numerical
  solutions for the main model of interest.
\item
  You may wish to summarize how numerical results for your model change
  depending on the parameter values used.
\item
  Depending on your project, you may wish to explore different types of
  more advanced analyses, i.e.~perturbation analysis, sensitivity and
  uncertainty analysis, stochastic simulations based on the Gillespie
  algorithm, bifurcation diagrams, analysis of periodic systems, and
  model validation.
\item
  You do not need to hand in your code. If your numerical methods are
  complex or non-standard you may wish to provide your pseudo-code in an
  Appendix.
\item
  Your results should include at least 1 figure that is fully labeled
  and contains a figure caption.
\item
  Your results section does not need to include every analysis that you
  have done. Your results section should be logically organized and this
  may mean omitting analyses that `didn't work out' or you judge to be
  less important given later results that you were able to achieve. Your
  results should be appropriate given the question/hypothesis that you
  described in the Introduction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Interpret your results in terms of the main question/hypothesis.
\item
  Towards the beginning of the Discussion, typically there is a section
  that reiterates the highlights of the results section.
\item
  Your discussion should describe whether your results matched what was
  expected or not. Are your results consistent with other similar
  studies?
\item
  You should interpret your results in the context of the applied
  problem, i.e., what does a stability condition suggest in terms of the
  practical management of a system?
\item
  How did your assumptions affect your results?
\item
  Do your results suggest any avenues for future research?
\item
  Highlight what is novel about your work.
\end{itemize}

You are to provide a complete bibliography of literature cited. You can
choose to use the referencing style of any scholarly scientific journal
or any of the preset options from Bibtex. The referencing style you use
must be consistent throughout.

\section{Oral report}\label{oral-report}

The content of your oral report should be similiar to the written
report.
