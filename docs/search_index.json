Give the citation for your answer in the style of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. This citation must be to a book (i.e., from the MUN library, or another an article from the peer-reviewed literature). [2 marks] Usually statistical models such as a linear regression satisfy my defintion of a mathematical model.

Thurs Jan 14: Getting started Assignment 1, Q5-6: to be handed in on Brightspace by Tues Jan 19 at 2pm. When deriving a mathematical model, some practical advice is: Modifying an existing model to suit your purposes is often a good approach; and The units in the terms of your model need to be consistent. We would like to derive a mathematical model for the following: Cooling beer in the freezer Room temperature beer can be cooled down by putting it in the freezer. If left too long, the beer will freeze and burst the glass making it undrinkable. How long can the beer be left in the freezer? Read Box 2.1 on p30-31 of A biologists guide to mathematical modelling. Step 1 of the modelling process has been completed because the question has been provided. Next, we will skip to Step 4. Read about the cooling cup of coffee model below. We can borrow the cooling cup of coffee model to use as our model for the cooling beer in the freezer question. 3.1 The cooling cup of coffee The following is taken from Barnes &amp; Fulford (2002), section 9.1-9.2 starting of p218. We would like to know how long it will take a 60\\(^\\circ\\)C cup of coffee to drop to 40\\(^\\circ\\)C. To develop the model, we assume the cup of coffee is a uniform temperature throughout. The cup of coffee will cool as heat energy from the coffee is lost to its surroundings, which are at a lower temperature. Note that temperature is measured in degrees Celsius, while heat is measured in Joules or Watts (Joules per second). From physics, the equation for the change in the heat content of coffee, \\(Q_{hc}\\) (in Watts) is, \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{hc} = cm \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(c\\) is the heat specific constant (measured in Joules per degree Celcius per kilogram), \\(m\\) is the mass of the material being heated or cooled (in kilograms), and \\(U(t)\\) is the temperature in Celcius. Also, from physics the rate of heat exchange of an object which is hotter than its surroundings, \\(Q_{cs}\\), (in Watts) is, \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{cs} = hS(U(t)-u_s), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(h\\) is the constant of convective heat transfer (in Watts per \\(m^2\\) per degree Celcuis), \\(S\\) is the surface area from which heat is lost, \\(U(t)\\) is the temperature of the object and \\(u_s&lt;U(t)\\) is the temperature of the surroundings (in Celcius). Owing to the conservation of heat energy, the change in the heat content of coffee, \\(Q_{hc}\\), should be equal to the rate of heat exchange from the coffee to its surroundings, \\(Q_{cs}\\). As such, the equation for the cooling of the cup of coffee is, \\[\\begin{equation} cm \\frac{dU(t)}{dt}=-hS(U(t)-u_s). \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] The negative sign on the righthand side of equation (3.1) is to make sure both sides of the equation are consistent because \\(\\frac{dU(t)}{dt}\\) is negative while all other terms are positive. This is a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). It is possible to integrate this ODE to solve for \\(U(t)\\). If we assume that \\(U(0) = 60^\\circ C\\) we can then solve \\(t_{40}\\) such that \\(U(t_{40}) = 40^\\circ\\) C. Assume the constant of convective transfer is 10 Watts/m\\(^2\\)/\\(^\\circ\\)C. 3.2 Questions A1-2 Complete Step 4 from Box 2.1 on p30-31 of A biologists guide to mathematical modelling for the cooling beer problem. Write down the equation for the cooling beer model, define all the parameters and variables, also giving their units, contraints, and values. Calculate the units for each term in your equation to make sure the units are consistent across terms (i.e., perform a dimensional analysis). Note the difference between parameters and variables. For dynamical system models the dependent variables are the quantities that change over time. Time is the independent variable. Parameters are constants whose values are estimated. The dependent variables need to be assigned an initial value. You will need to do some research to estimate the values of the parameters and the initial condition for the variable in your model. Provide your evidence to support your parameter estimates. List any assumptions that you have made, either in your model formulation or regarding the parameter estimates. [6 marks] Complete some of Steps 5-7 from Box 2.1 on p30-31 of A biologists guide to mathematical modelling by doing the following [2 marks]: Solve the ODE to estimate the time to the beer bottle exploding. Sketch by hand or use a software to make a graph of the change in temperature over time. "],

Tues Jan 19: Deriving ordinary differential equation models Assignment 2: to be handed in to Brightspace on Tues Jan 26 by 2pm. Ordinary differential equation (ODEs) models are often appropriate for MATH 4190 final projects. The general form of an ODE model is: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:genCT} \\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \\mbox{rate of increase} - \\mbox{rate of decrease}. \\end{equation}\\] The units of rate quantities are `per time', although this may be number per time, mL per time, or simply, per time. The ODE model may contain multiple (or no) increase and/or decrease terms and there may be several equations coupled together. Generally, a parameter that correspnds to a rate is either constrained to be positive, non-negative, or has no constraints. When the rate parameter is \\(&gt;1\\) this means that, on average, more than one of the corresponding event occurs per time unit. Sometimes rate parameters are multiplied by probabilities. A parameter that is a probability is constrained to be \\(\\geq 0\\) and \\(\\leq 1\\). When deriving ODE models it is helpful to draw a diagram (i.e. Step 3, Box 2.1 on p30-31 of A biologists guide to mathematical modelling). 4.1 Questions A2-1 Draw a flow diagram for one of the systems of ODEs in In-host Mathematical Modelling of COVID-19 in Humans by Hernandez-Vargas and Velasco-Hernandeza. For the system of ODEs that you chose, provide a table listing the variables and the parameters, their units, and any constraints on their values. Be sure to clearly identify which are parameters and which are variables. To make your flow diagram, follow the rules described in Box 2.3: Drawing flow diagrams, on p44 of A biologists guide to mathematical modelling. This question does not need to be completed in Latex. You may work with pencil and paper and photograph your work. [5 marks] Derive your own system of ODEs for a between-host epidemic spread model. Assume that the epidemiology of the system is such that: The system has 3 variables: Susceptible host, \\(S(t)\\), Infected hosts, \\(I(t)\\), and Recovered hosts, \\(R(t)\\). For all of these variables the units are number. The rate that new susceptible hosts enter the population is \\(\\theta&gt;0\\) (units: number/time). The rate that susceptible hosts become infected due to coming into contact with the infected host is \\(\\beta S(t) I(t)/N(t)\\), where \\(N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)\\), and \\(\\beta&gt;0\\) is the transmission rate (units: 1/time). This term results in both a decrease in \\(\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\\) and an increase in \\(\\frac{dI(t)}{dt}\\). The rate that infected indviduals recover is \\(\\gamma I(t)\\), where \\(\\gamma &gt;0\\) (units: 1/time). This term results in both a decrease in \\(\\frac{dI(t)}{dt}\\) and an increase in \\(\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}\\). Recovered individuals lose immunity at rate \\(\\omega R(t)\\). This term results in both a decrease in \\(\\frac{dR(t)}{dt}\\) and an increase in \\(\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\\). You may work on pencil and paper and photograph your work. [5 marks] "],
["a2-thurs-jan-21-deriving-recursion-equation-models.html", "5 A2. Thurs Jan 21: Deriving recursion equation models 5.1 Questions A2-2", " 5 A2. Thurs Jan 21: Deriving recursion equation models Assignment 2: to be handed in to Brightspace on Tues Jan 26 by 2pm. Recursion equation models update the value of your dependent variables at regular intervals, i.e. after one year, rather than continuously as they would for an ordinary differential equation model. Recursion equation models are referred to as discrete time models, whereas ordinary differential equation models are referred to as continuous time models. The general equation for a recursion equation is, \\[\\begin{equation} n_{t+1} = n_t + \\mbox{increase} - \\mbox{decrease}, \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n_{t+1}\\) is the value of the variable at time, \\(t+1\\). Each term in the recursion equation (5.1) has the same units as the variable of interest. More complex models may consider the dynamics of multiple variables as systems of coupled recursion equations. For recursion equations, within a time step multiple events may occur. When an event occurs, the value of a variable will change, and so for recursion equation models, is it necessary to define an order of events. For example, consider a population dynamic model, \\[\\begin{equation} n_{t+1} = (1+b)(1-d)n_t, \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n_t\\) is the number of individuals in the population, \\(b&gt;0\\) is the number of offspring produced per individual in a time step (unitless) and \\(0 \\leq d \\leq 1\\) is the probability that an individual dies during a time step (unitless). What order of events has been assumed in equation (5.2)? Formally, we might define \\(n&#39;\\) as the number of individuals after births, and \\(n&#39;&#39;\\) as the number of individuals after mortality. Then, \\[\\begin{eqnarray} n&#39; &amp;=&amp; n_t + bn_t = (1+b)n_t, \\\\ n&#39;&#39; &amp;=&amp; n&#39; - dn&#39; = (1-d)n&#39;, \\\\ n&#39;&#39; &amp;=&amp; (1-d)(1+b)n_t, \\\\ n_{t+1} &amp;=&amp; (1-d)(1+b)n_t. \\end{eqnarray}\\] The above derivation assumes that births occur first and then mortality. Assuming the opposite: mortality occurs first and then births, would result in the same equation, however this is not always the case. 5.1 Questions A2-2 Assume that \\(\\theta &gt; 0\\) is the rate that individuals migrate into a population (units: number). Assume that \\(b&gt;0\\) is the per individual birth rate (unitless) and \\(0 \\leq d \\leq 1\\) is the probability that an individual dies during the time step (unitless). Choose two different orderings of events (migration, births, and deaths) such that the final equations are different. [4 marks] Consider two variations on a model for population growth, \\[\\begin{equation} n_{t+1} = n_t + bn_t, \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] and, \\[\\begin{equation} n_{t+1} = bn_t, \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(b\\) is a per individual birth rate (unitless). How might the description of \\(b\\), and the constraints on \\(b\\), be slightly different under either model formulation? The population grows when \\(n_{t+1}&gt;n_t\\). Assuming \\(n_0 &gt;0\\), what are the values of \\(b\\) for which the population grows under either model formulation? [2 marks] "],

You are to: derive and analyze an original mathematical model, extend and analyze an existing mathematical model, or explain, recreate and/or produce novel proofs for an existing analysis of a mathematical model involving advanced mathematics (i.e., graduate level). 16.1 Written Report Your written report should consist of four sections: Introduction, Model, Results, and Discussion (for more details see below). You must appropriately acknowledge results and models that are not your own work. Your written report must be no more than 10 pages (excluding references, figures, and appendices) and written in Latex. If you have more than 10 pages of important content, then you should choose to place some of this content in an Appendix. Some advice: - Start simple. Start with a model that you are confident that you will be able to produce some results for. When you fully understand simpler versions of your model, gradually add in more complexity. This prevents you from tackling a project this is ‘too hard’ and not getting any results. - Be concise. A good project is thoughtfully put together – it does not necessarily need to be overly complex or long. Guidelines for each section of the final project: 16.1.1 Introduction Describe the general question/problem of interest. Describe the real-world application in language that is accessible to a reader without prior knowledge of the application. Summarize relevant previous research from the scientific literature (i.e., scholarly journals and books) and clearly place the project within the context of what has already been done. Remember to cite modeling articles, not just articles that describe the details of your applied system. Don’t focus your literature research to narrowly. For example, if you project is on ‘moose-wolf population dynamics’ consider also the literature on predator-prey dynamics, which may contain mathematically equivalent model formulations. Concisely state the main objective, hypothesis or question of the project. Usually ends with a paragraph describing how the problem will be solved, i.e., the type of model and the type of analysis. 16.1.2 Model Your model should be a dynamical system. The model cannot be an autonomous linear system of differential equations or difference equations because the analysis of such a model is too simple. You may however, consider a simplification of the model you are interested in that is an autonomous linear system of equations, if it helps you to understand the non-linear or non-autonomous system of interest. Provide all details of the model to be analyzed. Define all the model parameters, variables, provide their word definitions and state their units. Provide the complete system of equations that comprises the model. If appropriate provide a table of parameter values (and references if literature sources are used to justify choices of parameter values). You should describe the assumptions of your model. You should provide enough detail that your model is reproducible. This may mean that you need to appendicize some material. Consider including a diagram that communicates the interactions present in your model. This is often useful. 16.1.3 Results If possible, consider special cases of your model that yield analytical solutions such as equilibria and local stability conditions. If it is possible to solve for the equilibrium values and/or to determine the local stability of equilibria for your model you must do so. Usually the results section of a MATH 4190 project includes numerical solutions for the main model of interest. You may wish to summarize how numerical results for your model change depending on the parameter values used. Depending on your project, you may wish to explore different types of more advanced analyses, i.e. perturbation analysis, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, stochastic simulations based on the Gillespie algorithm, bifurcation diagrams, analysis of periodic systems, and model validation. You do not need to hand in your code. If your numerical methods are complex or non-standard you may wish to provide your pseudo-code in an Appendix. Your results should include at least 1 figure that is fully labeled and contains a figure caption. Your results section does not need to include every analysis that you have done. Your results section should be logically organized and this may mean omitting analyses that ‘didn’t work out’ or you judge to be less important given later results that you were able to achieve. Your results should be appropriate given the question/hypothesis that you described in the Introduction. 16.1.4 Discussion Interpret your results in terms of the main question/hypothesis. Towards the beginning of the Discussion, typically there is a section that reiterates the highlights of the results section. Your discussion should describe whether your results matched what was expected or not. Are your results consistent with other similar studies? You should interpret your results in the context of the applied problem, i.e., what does a stability condition suggest in terms of the practical management of a system? How did your assumptions affect your results? Do your results suggest any avenues for future research? Highlight what is novel about your work. You are to provide a complete bibliography of literature cited. You can choose to use the referencing style of any scholarly scientific journal or any of the preset options from Bibtex. The referencing style you use must be consistent throughout. 16.2 Oral report The content of your oral report should be similiar to the written report. I am here to help! Please let me know if you have any questions. For writing tips, you may consider: (1) Bliss et al. 2014 (p42-44); (2) “How to write a theoretical ecology paper that people will cite”; or (3) Webinar: How to write a modelling paper "]
