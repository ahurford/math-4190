# Tues Mar 9 - April 1: Work on your final report

During this time you should work on your final project. I will be available during class times (Tuesday and Thursday 2pm) on WebEx to give you guidance on how your project is going. Please email me (ahurford@mun.ca) to set up a meeting outside of class time.
