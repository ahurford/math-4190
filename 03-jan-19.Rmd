# A2. Tues Jan 19: Deriving ordinary differential equation models

Assignment 2: to be handed in to Brightspace on Tues Jan 26 by 2pm.

Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) models are often appropriate for MATH 4190 final projects. The general form of an ODE model is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:genCT}
\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \mbox{rate of increase} - \mbox{rate of decrease}.
\end{equation}

Using this general form, familiarizing yourself with some classic ODE models, ensuring the units of the terms in your ODE are consistent, and knowing the assumptions of ODE models, 

## HIV model
This model is modified from Otto and Day (2009).

*Variables*\
$S(t)$: number of susceptible T-cells (number, $S(t)\geq 0$).\
$L(t)$: number of latently infected T-cells (number, $L(t)\geq 0$).\
$A(t)$: number of actively infected cells T-cells (number, $A(t)\geq 0$).\
$V(t)$: amount of virus (number, $V(t)\geq 0$).\


*Parameters*\
$\Sigma:$ rate of production of susceptible T-cells (number/time, $\Sigma \geq 0$).\
$d:$ removal rate of T-cells (1/time, $d \geq 0$).\
$\beta:$ rate of T-cell infection (1/number/time, $\beta >0$).\
$p:$ fraction of infected T-cells that upon infection are latently infected (unitless, $1\geq p \geq 0$).\
$a:$ rate that latent T-cells become activated (1/time, $a \geq 0$).\
$\delta:$ death rate/removal of actively infected T-cells (1/time, $\delta \geq d$).\
$\pi:$ rate that virus is produced by actively infected T-cells  (1/time, $\pi > 0$).\
$\kappa:$ rate of virus removal (1/time, $\kappa > 0$.)

<!-- \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:HIV1} -->
<!-- \frac{dS(t)}{dt}&=& A - d S(t) - \beta V(t) R(t), \\ \nonumber -->
<!-- \frac{dL(t)}{dt}&=& p B - C - D, \\ \nonumber -->
<!-- \frac{dA(t)}{dt}&=& (1-p)B + \alpha L(t) - \delta E, \\ \nonumber -->

<!-- Note that each positive term in the above system of equations corresponds to the `rate of increase' and each negative term corresponds to the `rate of decrease' in the corresponding variables, as per equation genCT. -->

<!-- This model formulation assumes that only a small fraction of virus in the blood infects T-cells. This is evident because infection of T-cells does not appear as a loss term in the $\frac{dV}{dt}$ equation. The model also assumes that the rate of virus production is independent of the destruction of actively infected T-cells. Are there any terms in the model derivation that are surprising? Which terms are constant? Which terms are non-linear? -->

<!-- \emph{Exercise}\\ -->
<!-- Draw a diagram representing the dynamics of HIV (equation HIV1). -->



<!-- How are latently infected T-cells different from actively infected T-cells? How are some of the assumptions of this model evident your diagram. -->
